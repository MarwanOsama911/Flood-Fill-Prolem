Match 3 programming assignment

Unity version
Make sure the Unity version you use matches the one in the project. You can see that in Unity Hub, or by looking in the file ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt.

Game mechanics

The game mechanics are as follows:

- The game consists of m x n tiles (configurable in editor or code).

- If three or more of the same tile type are in a horizontal row, the game removes them.

- A tile falls down if there is no tile below it (unless it's on the bottom row).

- The user can click on a tile. The game then removes the tile.

- When the game starts, all the positions should be filled with tiles and nothing should fall down.

- Do not add more features than this.

Requirements

Do not use the physics engine to move the tiles.

Do not use raycasting for anything except if required to detect what tile the player clicked on.
